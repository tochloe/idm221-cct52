        <h3>I have always loved art, I went to an art school from 5-16 (if COVID never hit I might have still been enrolled). Growing up always being able to embrace my creative skills as a young artist felt staggering when faced with the reality of a college prep high school where STEM classes took my time and I became consumed with physics, calculus, chemistry, and the rest of the worst subjects in school. Art electives were seen as GPA boosters as they would be ‚Äúeasy A" classes and with no effort you could easily become the best graded in the class. There was no room for passion or opened doors for a creative soul to thrive.</h3>
        <h3>Faced with things I didn‚Äôt want to pursue and removed from the spaces from the things I loved doing, college applications without any support for art majors felt dull. The concept of UX/UI found its way to me summer of 2022 and my life changed. I felt like I finally found a place for. I grew up in an engineering family and arts and design have been aspects of my life that never failed me.</h3>
        <h3>Working in the service industry, I explicitly see the technological disparities that non-native English speakers face with unfamiliarity on top of the unwavering lack of support they get from corporations taking advantage of their desperation. In the service industry that has moved from handheld notepads to tablets and kiosks with little to no efficiency disrupts productivity. </h3>
