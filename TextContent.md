### The concept of art and design are blurred with the understanding of modernity in contemporary artists. Artists of all mediums are invalidated regardless of their background and experience. “It’s not a real job” “There’s no fulfillment” “It’s a waste of money”

What is User Experience Interaction Design?

…

How do we as humans interact with computers? We look at functions that are efficient and design a better way for people to connect and enjoy using technology without making them feel absorbed by the new technological advancements of the world!

THE MIDDLEGROUND OF ART AND TECHNOLOGY

# "FAKE" ART
#### INTRO:
With technological advancements changing the design industry with the unmaintained growth of AI, public opinion on graphic art has only gotten worse and worse. “FAKE” art, a term used for graphic design, animations, anything digitized for the matter, demeans the effort that digital artists put into their work. Photographers are looked down on when people think that the machine matters more than the eye to capture these moments. 

Design and art are not interchangeable terms. Design has intentional ideations for use/function seen in projects whereas art is not necessarily required to cater to an audience as it is for self exploration.

# "REAL" ART
#### INTRO:
Traditional art has been celebrated dating back to the prehistoric eras where clawing on walls used for storytelling were preserved and marveled at. Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, pillars of the Renaissance, are treated as Gods in their works in the art world. “Real” art describes the traditional mediums of painting, sculpture, mixed media, etc; 

Art is molded by society; culture, social changes, technological advancements are all things that impact what art looks like. It will not always be a painted acrylic still-life.

# ME
#### BACKGROUND
I have always loved art, I went to an art school from 5-16 (if COVID never hit I might have still been enrolled). Growing up always being able to embrace my creative skills as a young artist felt staggering when faced with the reality of a college prep high school where STEM classes took my time and I became consumed with physics, calculus, chemistry, and the rest of the worst subjects in school. Art electives were seen as GPA boosters as they would be “easy a” classes and with no effort you could easily become the best graded in the class. There was no room for passion or opened doors for a creative soul to thrive.

Faced with things I didn’t want to pursue and removed from the spaces from the things I loved doing, college applications without any support for art majors felt dull. The concept of UX/UI found its way to me summer of 2022 and my life changed. I felt like I finally found a place for. I grew up in an engineering family and arts and design have been aspects of my life that never failed me. 

Working in the service industry, I explicitly see the technological disparities that non-native English speakers face with unfamiliarity on top of the unwavering lack of support they get from corporations taking advantage of their desperation. In the service industry that has moved from handheld notepads to tablets and kiosks with little to no efficiency disrupts productivity.
