Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Raphael, pillars of the Renaissance, are treated as Gods in their works in the art world. “Real” art describes the traditional mediums of painting, sculpture, mixed media, etc;

    <h3>Art is molded by society; culture, social changes, technological advancements are all things that impact what art looks like. It will not always be a painted acrylic still-life.</h3>
