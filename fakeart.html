<div id="intro">
<h3>With technological advancements changing the design industry with the unmaintained growth of AI, public opinion on graphic art has only gotten worse and worse. “FAKE” art, a term used for graphic design, animations, anything digitized for the matter, demeans the effort that digital artists put into their work. Photographers are looked down on when people think that the machine matters more than the eye to capture these moments.
    Design and art are not interchangeable terms. Design has intentional ideations for use/function seen in projects whereas art is not necessarily required to cater to an audience as it is for self exploration.</h3>
